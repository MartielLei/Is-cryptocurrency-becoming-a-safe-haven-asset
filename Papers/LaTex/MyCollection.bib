abstract = {Using the spillover index approach and its variants, we examine both static and dynamic volatility connectedness among eight typical cryptocurrencies. The results reveal that their connectedness fluctuates cyclically and has shown an obvious rise trend since the end of 2016. In the variance decomposition framework, we further construct a volatility connectedness network linking 52 cryptocurrencies using the LASSO-VAR for estimating high-dimensional VARs. We find that these 52 cryptocurrencies are tightly interconnected and “mega-cap” cryptocurrencies are more likely to propagate volatility shocks to others. However, some unnoticeable cryptocurrencies (e.g., Maidsafe Coin) are also significant net-transmitters of volatility connectedness and even have larger contribution of volatility spillovers to others.},

The empirical results reveal that the systemic risk has a moderate adverse effect on Islamic indexes, with a lower level in Gulf Cooperation Council countries (GCC hereafter). The findings also show the Asian stock indexes can be considered as effective hedge assets, after the global financial crisis (GFC hereafter). Furthermore, the empirical reveal that portfolio including Islamic stock indexes performs better than a benchmark portfolio in turmoil periods.

This paper provides a comprehensive review on the financial applications of Bitcoin. The focus is on three lines of research: price formation, detection of market inefficiency, and diversified portfolio construction. Topics such as market micro-structure and the interplay between different cryptocurrencies are only touched on briefly. We observe that many empirical studies find that Bitcoin markets are inefficient, with huge price fluctuations and long-range memory, and that these markets are heavily influenced by news and sector-specific events, or by infrastructure conditions such as volume trading and market liquidity. Nevertheless, astonishing price appreciations and modest correlation values versus other asset classes have contributed significantly to motivate applications of Bitcoin to investment and diversification. Future research may address practical implementations of such solutions and investigate the long-term sustainability and viability of these investment strategies.},

abstract = {We use a data-driven methodology, namely the directed acyclic graph, to uncover the contemporaneous and lagged relations between Bitcoin and other asset classes. The adopted methodology allows us to identify causal networks based on the measurements of observed correlations and partial correlations, without relying on a priori assumptions. Results from the contemporaneous analysis indicate that the Bitcoin market is quite isolated, and no specific asset plays a dominant role in influencing the Bitcoin market. However, we find evidence of lagged relationships between Bitcoin and some assets, especially during the bear market state of Bitcoin. This finding suggests that the integration between the Bitcoin and other financial assets is a continuous process that varies over time. We conduct forecast error variance decompositions and find that the influence of each of the other assets on Bitcoin over a 20-day horizon does not account for more than 11{\%} of all innovations.},

abstract = {Using a generalized vector autoregressive framework in which forecast-error variance decompositions are invariant to the variable ordering, we propose measures of both the total and directional volatility spillovers. We use our methods to characterize daily volatility spillovers across US stock, bond, foreign exchange and commodities markets, from January 1999 to January 2010. We show that despite significant volatility fluctuations in all four markets during the sample, cross-market volatility spillovers were quite limited until the global financial crisis, which began in 2007. As the crisis intensified, so too did the volatility spillovers, with particularly important spillovers from the stock market to other markets taking place after the collapse of the Lehman Brothers in September 2008. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Institute of Forecasters.},

abstract = {In recent years a new type of tradable assets appeared, generically known as cryptocurrencies. Among them, the most widespread is Bitcoin. Given its novelty, this paper investigates some statistical properties of the Bitcoin market. This study compares Bitcoin and standard currencies dynamics and focuses on the analysis of returns at different time scales. We test the presence of long memory in return time series from 2011 to 2017, using transaction data from one Bitcoin platform. We compute the Hurst exponent by means of the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis method, using a sliding window in order to measure long range dependence. We detect that Hurst exponents changes significantly during the first years of existence of Bitcoin, tending to stabilize in recent times. Additionally, multiscale analysis shows a similar behavior of the Hurst exponent, implying a self-similar process.},

abstract = {In the present paper, we investigate connectedness within cryptocurrency markets as well as across the Bitcoin index (hereafter, BPI) and widely traded asset classes such as traditional currencies, stock market indices and commodities, such as gold and Brent oil. A spill over index approach with the spectral representation of variance decomposition networks, is employed to measure connectedness. Results show no significant spillover effects between the nascent market of cryptocurrencies and other financial markets. We suggest that cryptocurrencies are real independent financial instruments that pose no danger to financial system stability. Concerning the connectedness within the cryptocurrency markets, we report a time–frequency–dynamics connectedness nature. Moreover, the decomposition of the total spill over index is mostly dominated by a short frequency component (2–4 days) leading to the conclusion that this nascent market is highly speculative at present. These findings provide insights for regulators and potential international investors.},

A new class of multivariate models called dynamic conditional correlation models is proposed. These have the flexibility of univariate GARCH models coupled with parsimonious parametric models for the correlations. They are not linear but can often be estimated very simply with univariate or two-step methods based on the likelihood function. It is shown that they perform well in a variety of situations and provide sensible empirical results.},
